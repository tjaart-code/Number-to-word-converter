## Run the Program

Run the compiled Java class with the java command, passing any number you want to convert as a command-line argument.

For example:

You should see output like:

<code>Input: 123456  
Output: one hundred twenty three thousand four hundred fifty six</code>

#### Notes:

You can run the program with different numbers as arguments, including negative numbers like -456.

<code>java WordConverter -456</code>

This would output:

<code>Input: -456  
Output: negative four hundred fifty six</code>
